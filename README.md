# simulated_annealing

Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. The name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to increase the size of its crystals and reduce their defects.

This repo contains simulated annealing algorithm in python.
